## AAS Nova Article on Our Work on CN Cha

The American Astronomical Society (AAS) has a public outreach website, [Nova][aas-nova], which promotes work published in their journals for more general, public consumption. In March of 2021, Nova decided to [feature][aas-nova-cncha] our work on the Symbiotic Nova CN Cha, which you can find the full paper on [here][our-cncha]. This work also [piqued the interest][amateurs-on-cncha] of several amateur astronomers!

## FDM on The Star Spot Podcast

I was invited on to [The Star Spot][starspot] Podacst hosted by Justin Trottier to discuss my work with [Dr. Philip Mocz][philip] on Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM). The [interview][starspot-episode] covers the background of this strange flavor of Dark Matter and the several works spear-headed by Philip on how cosmological structure is formed in this Dark Matter paradigm. One of these works went on to [win the third place][buchalter] in the 2020 Buchalter Prize in Cosmology.

## ChuTalk at Churchill College, Cambridge

This is a talk I gave to fellow graduate students at Churchill College in Cambridge, UK in February of 2017 while I was in a masters program there. The talk was aimed at trying to explain some of the common questions I heard from friends about "The Universe."

I am currently working on explanding this page with some short descriptions of some of my research projects. For now I have 
<a href="../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">my CV</a> (last update August 9th, 2021), a list of my publications which can be found [here][my-ads-lib], and a short description of my path in academia.

For those who prefer to search for me with an ORCiD, mine is 0000-0002-0041-4356

# Academic Story

I went to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University, intending to double major in physics and philosophy, I eventually got too hooked on math and switched to physics and mathematics, specializing in astrophysics.

Inspired by my undergrad research in Galactic Dynamics with [Dr. Matthew Walker][matt-walker] and my summer research experience for undergraduates (REU) in Cosmology with [Dr. Lloyd Knox][lloyd-knox], I applied to graduate school in astrophysics. Before I started the PhD program in the Princeton Astrophysics Department, I completed [Part III][part-iii] of the Mathematical Tripos at the Institute of Astronomy (IoA) at Cambridge University in England. While in Cambridge I did research with [Dr. Vasily Belokurov][vasily] and [Dr. Wyn Evans][wyn] on the structure of the Milky Way's Stellar Halo.


Since starting my PhD at Princeton in 2017 I have worked on a large variety of topics in Astrophysics. My work under [Dr. David Spergel][david] has caused me to travel very often to the [Center for Computational Astrophysics][cca] (CCA) whre I have also collaborated with many other researchers. I have also worked closely with [Dr. Jenny Greene][jenny] on observational projects related to Intermediate Mass Black Holes.

In 2019 I started my thesis work with [Dr. Eve Ostriker][eve], though I also work closely with [Chang-Goo Kim][cgk] and [Jeong-Gyu Kim][jgk]. While my thesis was originally

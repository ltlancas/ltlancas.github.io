I was born in the beautiful city of Sydney, Australia and moved to Connecticut in the U.S. when I was three, where I spent the rest of my childhood (sorry, I have no fun accent). I competitively rowed for most of my childhood and a tad in college. I really have too many hobbies to list but some of them are hiking/backpacking, cooking, brewing beer, biking, painting, stained glass art, and (very amateur) carpentry.

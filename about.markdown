I was born in the beautiful city of Sydney, Australia and moved to Connecticut in the U.S. when I was three, where I spent the rest of my childhood (sorry, I have no fun accent). I competitively rowed for most of my childhood and a tad in college. I really have too many hobbies to list but some of them are hiking/backpacking, cooking, biking, painting, stained glass art, and (very amateur) carpentry.

## Hiking

I really enjoy hiking/backpacking and I've had the great opportunity to do it all over the U.S. The picture at the right (backlit, I know) is from my most recent trip to the White Mountains National Forest in New Hampshire, I'm standing at the summit of Mt. Jefferson and Mt. Washington is in the background.
